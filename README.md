# Thyristor-switched capacitor (TSC)
FC-TCR SVC can change the real and reactive power flow and force the output o f the generator become balanced even though the load is unbalanced.
A static VAR compensator is a parallel combination of controlled reactor and fixed shunt capacitor shown in the figure below.
